## Implementation

This game was created in Godot 4.1.1


This game includes:
 - custom made map (credits to my friend DarkTThund3r!!)
 - Interesting lighting and shading
 - 3 NPCs to interact with
 - CSGMesh Characters
 - Maze in drain system
 - 2 different implemented endings (more to be added in future)
 - Inventory system
 - Music and Sound
 - custom art


## What Makes this a Game?

This game has a compelling structure in which the player attempts to survive to the best of their ability and "win", navigating through different choices and places. The player is able to control their character movement and the way they interact with the map and other NPCs. This behavior is somewhat consistent with the autonomy, competence, and relatedness dimensions of Self Determination theory.
This game is based off a text based adventure game.
